# Backend Challenge Incomplete Work

> Spent more time on the frontend and realized I was too low on time to complete the backend work. Backend is set up in node.js

- Endpoints are set up for creating a user, event, and a reservation.
- Need to set up reservation constraints.
- Need to only return signed in user's reservations - currently just shows all reservations.
